# AnetA8-BIQU-SKR2
This is my config for BIQU SKR2 main board RevB that run Anet A8 3D printer hardware

I have a custom attachment for 3D touch so please be careful at 
  #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { 55, 0, -2.5 } 
directive.

Stepper drivers are tmc2226 but using tmc2209 drivers
Steppers are original Anet A8 steppers.

Use 3d Touch with the z End pin.
